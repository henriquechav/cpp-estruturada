# Class 04 - Functions

In this lesson I learned about functions in C++. Functions are blocks of code executed each time they are called through an interface. We can think of them as machines that receive from us some kind of data, and then return an expected result. Example: we use `sqrt()` from `cmath` library by passing a number we would like to know the square root of. 

We can also define our own functions, instead of using pre-existing ones. For that, we need to create a prototype describing the types of arguments and return values. Is important to notice that in some cases functions doesn't return anything (`void` is the return value type). 

Functions exist to organize the source code and to allow programmers to reuse code without typing it again each time in order to do something. It is the main property of structured programming.
